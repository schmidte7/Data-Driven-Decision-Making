###Question 3

#From the regression model above the estimated coefficient for the Log_number predictor variable is negative (-0.154991), 
which suggests that as the number of solar panels produced (cumulative production or experience) increases, 
the manufacturing cost per unit decreases. 
The experience curve estimate can be used to predict the average manufacturing cost per unit for a given level of cumulative production or experience.

#Therefore we have calculated the expected cost per solar panel for each quantity of interest 
(result: 2.95) and cost for the 400 solar panels produced (result: 1180.4). 
In the scatterplot matrix with log data, we have noticed a cost of 1200 for 800 solar 
that means producing 400 of them will cost us around 15.5% less. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# predict the cost of manufacturing 4700, 4800, 4900, and 5000 solar panels
x <-  data.frame(c(4700, 4800, 4900, 5000))
y_pred <- predict(lin_reg_helio, newdata = x)

#calculate the expected average manufacturing cost per solar panel
mean_cost <- mean(y_pred)
mean_cost

#compute cost for the 400 solar panels produced
mean_cost * 400
```

###Question 4

#This confidence interval is for the regression coefficients of the regression model 
with Log_cost as the response variable and Log_number as the predictor variable. 
Specifically, the 95% confidence interval for the intercept (the coefficient for the constant term) is (3.3600629, 3.4586432), 
and the 95% confidence interval for the coefficient of Log_number is (-0.1715456, -0.1384356).

#The interpretation of a confidence interval is that if we were to repeatedly sample data 
from the population and calculate confidence intervals in the same way, approximately 95% of those intervals 
would contain the true value of the population parameter (in this case, the true value of the intercept or coefficient). 
In other words, we are 95% confident that the true value of the intercept is between 3.3600629 and 3.4586432, 
and we are 95% confident that the true value of the coefficient of Log_number is between -0.1715456 and -0.1384356.
